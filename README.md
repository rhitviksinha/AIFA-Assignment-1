### Problem chosen for assignment:

**Electric Vehicle**

Consider a city network where we need to route a set of electric vehicles
which may require to be charged during its journey from some source to some destination. Let
us assume that we have n cities (`v1`, `v2`, . . . , `vn`) and the distance between cities `vi` and `vj` be
`eij` (if two cities are not connected directly then `eij = âˆž` and `eij = eji`). Assume that each city
has a single charging station which can charge one EV at a time. Consider a set of `k` EVs namely
`P1`, `P2`, . . . , `Pk`. For each EV the following information is provided -

(a) `Sr` - source node  
(b) `Dr` - destination node  
(c) `Br` - battery charge status initially  
(d) `cr` - charging rate for battery at a charging station (energy per unit time)  
(e) `dr` - discharging rate of battery while traveling (distance travel per unit charge)  
(f) `Mr` - maximum battery capacity  
(g) `sr` - average traveling speed (distance per unit time).

Assume that all vehicles start their journey at `t = 0` and `Pr` reaches it destination at `t = Tr`. We
need to route all the vehicles from their respective sources to destinations such that `max{Tr}`
is minimized. You need to develop both optimal as well as heuristic algorithms.
